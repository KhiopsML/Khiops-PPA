Description: software for data mining
 Khiops is a data preparation and scoring tool for supervised learning
 and unsupervised learning. It allows one to perform univariate and
 bivariate descriptive statistics, to evaluate the predictive
 importance of explanatory variables, to discretize numerical
 variables, to group the values of categorical variables, to recode
 input data according to these discretizations and value groupings. It
 allows one to perform multi-table relational mining with automatic
 variable construction. Khiops also produces a scoring model for
 supervised learning tasks, according to a Selective Naive Bayes
 approach, either for classification or for regression.  Khiops is
 available both in user interface mode and in batch mode, such that it
 can easily be embedded as a software component in a data mining
 deployment projet.

Description: Khiops Native Interface
 The purpose of Khiops Native Interface (KNI) is to allow a deeper integration
 of Khiops in information systems, by mean of the C programming language, using
 a dynamic link library (DLL). This relates specially to the problem of model
 deployment, which otherwise requires the use of input and output data files
 when using directly the Khiops tool in batch mode. See Khiops Guide for an
 introduction to dictionary files, dictionaries, database files and deployment.
  .
 The Khiops deployment features are thus made public through an API with a DLL.
 Therefore, a Khiops model can be deployed directly from any programming
 language, such as C, C++, Java, Python, Matlab, etc. This enables real time
 model deployment without the overhead of temporary data files or launching
 executables. This is critical for certain applications, such as marketing or
 targeted advertising on the web.
  .
 All KNI functions are C functions for easy use with other programming languages.
 They return a positive or zero value in case of success, and a negative error
 code in case of failure. The functions are not reentrant (thread-safe): the DLL
 can be used simultaneously by several executables, but not simultaneously by
 several threads in the same executable.
  .
 See KhiopsNativeInterface.h for a detailed description of KNI functions

 They return a positive or zero value in case of success, and a negative error
 code in case of failure. The functions are not reentrant (thread-safe): the DLL
 can be used simultaneously by several executables, but not simultaneously by
 several threads in the same executable.

Description: Khiops Native Interface
 The purpose of Khiops Native Interface (KNI) is to allow a deeper integration
 of Khiops in information systems, by mean of the C programming language, using
 a dynamic link library (DLL). This relates specially to the problem of model
 deployment, which otherwise requires the use of input and output data files
 when using directly the Khiops tool in batch mode. See Khiops Guide for an
 introduction to dictionary files, dictionaries, database files and deployment.
  .
 The Khiops deployment features are thus made public through an API with a DLL.
 Therefore, a Khiops model can be deployed directly from any programming
 language, such as C, C++, Java, Python, Matlab, etc. This enables real time
 model deployment without the overhead of temporary data files or launching
 executables. This is critical for certain applications, such as marketing or
 targeted advertising on the web.

 All KNI functions are C functions for easy use with other programming languages.
 They return a positive or zero value in case of success, and a negative error
